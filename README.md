# Lexical Analizer
 A lexical analyzer (or lexer) is the first phase of a compiler, responsible for reading source code and breaking it into meaningful sequences called tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, literals). It removes whitespace and comments and checks for invalid tokens, serving as the bridge between the source code and the parser.
